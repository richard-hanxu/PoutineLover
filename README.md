Hi, I'm Richard Hanxu, and I'm a 2T5 Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto.

My hobbies include fencing 🤺, watching the NBA 🏀 (Go Raptors!!!), and reading about math and computer science.

I am passionate about working with machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am always interested in new opportunities!
